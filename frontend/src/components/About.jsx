        I am a student, just like you (probably) here on F1 Visa, trying to create a life of myself here on my own.
        I am pretty excited that I am a student here at the University of Maryland, and after being here for a year now, I've realized that the information required for ENPM Courses is pretty low out there. There isn't a single place where I can easily look at Courses, Course reviews, course structure and whether that course is for me or not. So, this is the alpha launch where my goal is to improve information about the MAGE Program and do my part! Hopefully it proves to be helpful for you lot!!
